Duktape 1.3 release notes
=========================

Release overview
================

This release adds multiple new features and performance improvements:

* Extend buffer support with Khronos/ES6 TypedArray API (subset of ES6 API),
  Node.js Buffer API, external buffers, and related C API additions and
  changes; see
  http://wiki.duktape.org/HowtoBuffers.html

* Move to use an external duk_config.h header to improve portability and make
  Duktape easier to use as a library; this is a work in progress, see
  https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/doc/duk-config.rst

* Support module.exports

* Bytecode dump/load support, and related C API additions

* New API calls ``duk_instanceof()`` and ``duk_pnew()``

* Performance improvements for e.g. bytecode opcode dispatch, JSON parsing and
  serialization, and lexer/compiler buffer handling

Upgrading from Duktape 1.2.x
============================

No action (other than recompiling) should be needed for most users to upgrade
from Duktape v1.2.x.  Note the following:

* There's a new header file, ``duk_config.h``, which must be in the include
  path. A default duk_config.h file, compatible with Duktape 1.2, is present
  in dist src/ and src-separate/ directories.

* Duktape.modLoaded internal format has changed as a result of module.exports
  support.  This should not matter unless you need to interact with
  Duktape.modLoaded directly for some reason.

* Behavior for a CommonJS module load error has changed: the offending module
  is now de-registered instead of a partial module being cached.  This allows
  calling code to retry the failing ``require()`` call.

* DUK_OPT_DEEP_C_STACK has been removed and Duktape defaults to deep stacks
  on all platforms.  There are explicit C stack options for (rare) platforms
  with a shallow stack (e.g. DUK_USE_NATIVE_CALL_RECLIMIT,
  DUK_USE_COMPILER_RECLIMIT).

* Debugger breakpoint triggering behavior has changed so that breakpoints are
  only triggered when execution enters the exact breakpoint line.  Breakpoints
  on lines without any executable code are ignored.

* Some example files have been renamed.  For example,
  ``examples/debug-trans-socket/duk_debug_trans_socket.*`` have been renamed
  to ``examples/debug-trans-socket/duk_trans_socket.*``.

There are bug fixes and other minor behavioral changes which may affect some
applications, see ``RELEASES.rst`` for details.

Known issues
============

This release has the following known issues worth noting.

ECMAScript features
-------------------

* Non-compliant behavior for array indices near 2G or 4G elements.

* RegExp parser is strict and won't accept some real world RegExps which
  are technically not compliant with ECMAScript E5/E5.1 specification.

* Final mantissa bit rounding issues in the internal number-to-string
  conversion.

Portability and platforms
-------------------------

* On some older clang/llvm versions (e.g. Clang 3.3 on FreeBSD 10):
  when ``-m32`` is used, Duktape will end up using the 8-byte packed value
  representation but clang will generate incorrect code for union assignment
  (see ``misc/clang_aliasing.c``).  The issue can be detected by defining
  ``DUK_OPT_SELF_TESTS``.  A workaround is to avoid packed types in this
  case by defining ``DUK_OPT_NO_PACKED_TVAL``.

* On some older clang/llvm versions (e.g. Clang 3.3 on FreeBSD 10):
  compilation may produce a warning "generic selections are a C11-specific
  feature".  The warning should be harmless.

* On some older clang/llvm versions (e.g. Clang 3.3 on FreeBSD 10):
  harmless compilation warning for "duk_repl_isinf" being unused.

* On some GCC versions and compilation options you may get a warning
  "variable idx_func might be clobbered by longjmp or vfork [-Wclobbered]".
  This warning seems spurious and causes no known problems.

* GCC ``-O4`` may produce a warning "assuming signed overflow does not occur
  when assuming that (X - c) > X is always false" for some assertions.  This
  warning seems spurious and causes no known problems.

* GCC ``-pedantic`` without ``-std=c99`` causes the ``unsigned long long``
  type to be used by Duktape, and an associated warning about the type.
  This is harmless and most easily fixed by simply using ``-std=c99``.

* MSVC ``/Wp64`` produces harmless warnings when compiling for x86.  The
  warnings are caused by 64-bit incompatible code enabled for 32-bit targets;
  when you actually compile for a 64-bit target, those code paths are not
  used so the warnings are irrelevant.

* The JSON.stringify() fast path (DUK_USE_JSON_STRINGIFY_FASTPATH) assumes
  that "%lld" format specifier is correct for the "unsigned long long" type.

Raw issues from test runs
=========================

    test-numconv-tostring-misc: fail; 6 diff lines; known issue: rounding corner case, 1e+23 string coerces to 1.0000000000000001e+23
    test-regexp-empty-quantified: fail; 15 diff lines; known issue: a suitable empty quantified (e.g. '(x*)*') causes regexp parsing to terminate due to step limit

    test-regexp-nonstandard-patternchar: fail; 6 diff lines; known issue: other engines allow an unescaped brace to appear literally (e.g. /{/), Duktape does not (which seems correct but is against real world behavior)
    test-stmt-for-in-lhs: fail; 29 diff lines; known issue: for-in allows some invalid left-hand-side expressions which cause a runtime ReferenceError instead of a compile-time SyntaxError (e.g. 'for (a+b in [0,1]) {...}')
