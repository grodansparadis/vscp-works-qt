<h2>Value stacks</h2>

<p>This document uses the following stack notation.  Stacks are represented
visually with the stack growing to the right.  For instance, after:</p>

<pre class="c-code">
duk_push_number(ctx, 123);
duk_push_string(ctx, "foo");
duk_push_true(ctx);
</pre>

<p>the stack would look like:</p>

<pre class="stack">
[ 123 "foo" true ]
</pre>

<p>The elements on the stack which don't affect the operation are denoted
with a single element with ellipsis ("..."):</p>

<pre class="stack">
[ ... ]
</pre>

<p>The elements actively operated on, either being read, written, inserted,
or removed, have a white background:</p>

<pre class="stack">
[ ... obj! key! ]
</pre>

<p>Elements which are identified by an explicit index in an API call are
indicated with surrounding ellipsis elements, to emphasize that they may
be anywhere in the stack:</p>

<pre class="stack">
[ ... obj! ... key! value! ]
</pre>

<p>In some cases the index of an element may be emphasized with a number
or symbolic value in parenthesis:</p>
<pre class="stack">
[ ... val(index)! val(index+1)! ... ]
</pre>

<p>Stack transformation is represented with an arrow and two stacks:</p>

<pre class="stack">
[ ... obj! ... key! value! ] -> [ ... obj! ... ]
</pre>
