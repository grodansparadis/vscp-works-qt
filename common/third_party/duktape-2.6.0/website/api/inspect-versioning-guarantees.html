<div class="note">
The result object is not under versioning guarantees so its properties
may change even in minor releases (but not patch releases).  This is a
practical compromise: internals change quite frequently, so the choices are
either to make no versioning guarantees or avoid exposing internals at all.
As such, calling code should never rely on having a certain set of fields
available, and it may be necessary to check <code>DUK_VERSION</code> when
interpreting the result fields.
