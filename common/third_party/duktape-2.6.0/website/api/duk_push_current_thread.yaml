name: duk_push_current_thread

proto: |
  void duk_push_current_thread(duk_context *ctx);

stack: |
  [ ... ] -> [ ... thread! ]  (if current thread exists)
  [ ... ] -> [ ... undefined! ]  (if no current thread)

summary: |
  <p>Push the currently running Duktape thread to the stack.  The value pushed
  is a thread object which is also an ECMAScript object.  If there is no current
  thread, <code>undefined</code> is pushed instead.</p>

  <p>The current thread is (almost always) the thread represented by the
  <code>ctx</code> pointer.</p>

  <p>To get the <code>duk_context *</code> associated with the thread, use
  <code><a href="#duk_get_context">duk_get_context()</a></code>.</p>

example: |
  duk_push_thread(ctx);
