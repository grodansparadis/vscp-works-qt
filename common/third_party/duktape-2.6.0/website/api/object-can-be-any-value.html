<div class="note">
Although the base value for property accesses is usually an object, it can
technically be an arbitrary value.  Plain string and buffer values have virtual
index properties so you can access <code>"foo"[2]</code>, for instance.
Most primitive values also inherit from some prototype object so that you can
e.g. call methods on them: <code>(12345).toString(16)</code>.
