name: duk_push_heap_stash

proto: |
  void duk_push_heap_stash(duk_context *ctx);

stack: |
  [ ... ] -> [ ... stash! ]

summary: |
  <p>Push the heap stash object to the stack.  The heap stash is an internal
  object which can be used to store key/value pairs from C code so that they are
  reachable for garbage collection, but are not accessible from ECMAScript code.
  The stash is only accessible from C code; the same stash object is used by all
  code sharing the same Duktape heap (even if they don't share the same global
  object).</p>

example: |
  duk_push_heap_stash(ctx);
