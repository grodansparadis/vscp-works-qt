name: duk_resume

proto: |
  void duk_resume(duk_context *ctx, const duk_thread_state *state);

stack: |
  [ ... state(N)! ] -> [ ... ] (number of popped stack entries may vary)

summary: |
  <p>Resume Duktape execution previously suspended using
  <code><a href="#duk_suspend">duk_suspend()</a></code>.  The <code>state</code>
  argument must not be NULL.  Value stack and <code>state</code> must be in the
  state where they were left by <code>duk_suspend()</code>; if that's not the
  case, memory unsafe behavior will happen.</p>

  /* See example for duk_suspend(). */
