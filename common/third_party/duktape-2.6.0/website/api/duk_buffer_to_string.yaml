name: duk_buffer_to_string

proto: |
  const char *duk_buffer_to_string(duk_context *ctx, duk_idx_t idx);

stack: |
  [ ... val! ... ] -> [ ... buffer_to_string(val)! ... ]

summary: |
  <p>Replace the buffer value (plain buffer or any buffer object) at
  <code>idx</code> with a string whose internal byte representation is taken
  1:1 from the buffer (same as if the buffer data was pushed using
  <code>duk_push_lstring()</code>).  Returns a non-<code>NULL</code>
  pointer to the read-only, NUL-terminated string data.  A TypeError is
  thrown if (1) the argument is not a buffer value, (2) the argument is
  a buffer object whose backing buffer doesn't cover the apparent
  buffer size, (3) the index is invalid.</p>

  <p>Because the buffer data is used as is for the string created, this
  API call allows creation of Symbol values unless the buffer data is
  first sanitized.</p>

  <div class="note">
  Since Duktape 2.0 the <code>duk_to_string()</code> coercion for a buffer
  value is typically something like "[object Uint8Array]", which is not
  usually intended.

example: |
  unsigned char *ptr;
  ptr = (unsigned char *) duk_push_fixed_buffer(ctx, 4);
  ptr[0] = 0x61;
  ptr[1] = 0x62;
  ptr[2] = 0x63;
  ptr[3] = 0x64;  /* 61 62 63 64 */
  printf("coerced string: %s\n", duk_buffer_to_string(ctx, -1));
  duk_pop(ctx);
