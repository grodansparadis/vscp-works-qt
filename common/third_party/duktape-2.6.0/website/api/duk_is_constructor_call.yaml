name: duk_is_constructor_call

proto: |
  duk_bool_t duk_is_constructor_call(duk_context *ctx);

summary: |
  <p>Return non-zero if current function was called as a constructor
  (<code>new Foo()</code> instead of <code>Foo()</code>); otherwise returns 0.</p>

  <p>This call allows a C function to have different behavior for normal
  and constructor calls (as is the case for many built-in functions).</p>

example: |
  if (duk_is_constructor_call(ctx)) {
      printf("called as a constructor\n");
  } else {
      printf("called as a normal function\n");
  }
