name: duk_push_current_function

proto: |
  void duk_push_current_function(duk_context *ctx);

stack: |
  [ ... ] -> [ ... func! ]  (if current function exists)
  [ ... ] -> [ ... undefined! ]  (if no current function)

summary: |
  <p>Push the currently running function to the stack.  The value pushed is
  an ECMAScript Function object.  If there is no current function,
  <code>undefined</code> is pushed instead.</p>

  <p>If the current function was called via one or more bound functions or a
  Proxy object, the function returned from this call is the final, resolved
  function (not the bound function or the Proxy).</p>

  <p>This function allows a C function to gain access to its function object.
  Since multiple function objects can internally point to the same C function,
  a function object is a convenient place for function parameterization and
  can also act as an internal state stash.</p>

  duk_push_current_function(ctx);
