name: duk_debugger_pause

proto: |
  void duk_debugger_pause(duk_context *ctx);

summary: |
  <p>Request a debugger pause as soon as possible and return without blocking.
  The pause will be triggered the next time ECMAScript bytecode is executed,
  which is usually almost immediate.  However, if a native call such as a
  Duktape/C function is in progress or no ECMAScript code is currently
  executing, it may take longer for the pause to take effect.</p>

  <p>The call is a no-op if (1) debugger support has not been compiled in, (2)
  the debugger is not attached, or (3) Duktape is already paused.  This mimics
  the semantics of the ECMAScript <code>debugger</code> statement.</p>

  <div class="note">
  Like all Duktape API calls, this call is not thread safe.  It may be tempting
  to trigger a pause from a thread different than one running ECMAScript code
  for the context, but this is unsafe and not currently supported.
  </div>

example: |
  /* In your event loop: */
  if (key_pressed == KEY_F12) {
      duk_debugger_pause(ctx);
  }
