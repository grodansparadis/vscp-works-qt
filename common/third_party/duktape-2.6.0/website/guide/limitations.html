<h1 id="limitations">Limitations</h1>

<p>The following is a list of known limitations of the current implementation.
Limitations include shortcomings from a semantics perspective, performance
limitations, and implementation limits (which are inevitable).</p>

<p>Trivial bugs are not listed unless they are "long term bugs".</p>

<h2>No re-entrancy</h2>

<p>A single Duktape heap, i.e. contexts sharing the same garbage collector,
is <b>not re-entrant</b>.  Only one C/C++ thread can call Duktape APIs
at a time for a particular Duktape heap (although the calling thread
can change over time).  See <a href="#threading">Threading</a>.</p>

<h2>String and buffer limits</h2>

<p>The internal representation allows a maximum length of 2**31-1 (0x7fffffff)
<i>bytes</i> (not characters) for strings.  16-bit codepoints encode into 3
bytes of UTF-8 in the worst case, so the maximum string length which is
guaranteed to work is about 0.7G characters.</p>

<p>Buffer values are also limited to 2**31-1 (0x7fffffff) bytes.</p>

<h2>Property limits</h2>

<p>An object can have at most <code>DUK_HOBJECT_MAX_PROPERTIES</code> (an
internal define).  Currently this limit is 0x7ffffffff.</p>

<h2>Array limits</h2>

<p>When array item indices go over the 2**31-1 limit (0x7fffffff), Duktape
has some known bugs with array semantics.</p>

<h2>Regexp quantifier over empty match</h2>

<p>The regexp engine gets stuck when a quantifier is used over an
empty match but eventually bails out with an internal recursion
(or execution step) limit.  For instance, the following should produce
a "no match" result but hits an internal recursion limit instead:</p>

<pre>
$ duk
duk&gt; t = /(x*)*/.exec('y');
RangeError: regexp executor recursion limit
    at [anon] (duk_regexp_executor.c:145) internal
    at exec () native strict preventsyield
    at global (input:1) preventsyield
</pre>

<h2>Duktape does not fully support locales</h2>

<p>Although Duktape supports the concept of a local time, it doesn't support
other locale related features such as: locale specific Date formatting,
locale specific string comparison, locale/language specific Unicode rules
(such as case conversion rules for Turkish, Azeri, and Lithuanian).</p>

<h2>Unicode case conversion is not locale or context sensitive</h2>

<p>E5 Sections 15.5.4.16 to 15.5.4.19 require context and locale processing
of Unicode <code>SpecialCasing.txt</code>.  However, Duktape doesn't currently
have a notion of "current locale".</p>

<h2>Array performance when using non-default property attributes</h2>

<p>All array elements are expected to be writable, enumerable, and configurable
(default property attributes for new properties).  If this assumption is violated,
even temporarily, the entire "array part" of an object is abandoned permanently
and array entries are moved to the "entry part".  This involves interning all used
array indices as explicit string keys (e.g. "0", "1", etc).  This is not a
compliance concern, but degrades performance.</p>

<h2>Array performance when writing elements using Object.defineProperty()</h2>

<p>When number indexed array elements are written with <code>Object.defineProperty()</code>
the current implementation abandons the internal "array part" which makes later
array access much slower.  Write array elements with direct assignments such as
<code>a[123] = 321</code> to avoid this.</p>

<h2>Global/eval code is slower than function code</h2>

<p>Bytecode generated for global and eval code cannot assign variables
statically to registers, and will use explicit name-based variable
read/write accesses.  Bytecode generated for function code doesn't
have this limitation; most variables are assigned statically to registers
and direct register references are used used to access them.</p>

<p>This is a minor issue unless you spend a lot of time running top-level
global/eval code.  The workaround is simple: put code in a function which
you call from the top level; for instance:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
function main() {
    // ...
}
main();
</pre>

<p>There is also a common idiom of using an anonymous function for this
purpose:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
(function () {
    // ...
})();
</pre>

<h2>Function temporaries may be live for garbage collection longer than expected</h2>

<p>ECMAScript functions are compiled into bytecode with a fixed set of
registers.  Some registers are reserved for arguments and variable
bindings while others are used as temporaries.  All registers are
considered live from a garbage collection perspective, even temporary
registers containing old values which the function actually cannot
reference any more.  Such temporaries are considered reachable until they
are overwritten by the evaluation of another expression or until the
function exits.  Function exit is the only easily predicted condition to
ensure garbage collection.</p>

<p>If you have a function which remains running for a very long time, it
should contain the bare minimum of variables and temporaries that could
remain live.  For instance, you can structure code like:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
function runOnce() {
    // run one iteration, lots of temporaries
}

function foreverLoop() {
    for (;;) {
        runOnce();
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This is typically not an issue if there are no long-running functions.</p>

<h2>Function instances are garbage collected only by mark-and-sweep</h2>

<p>Every ECMAScript function instance is, by default, in a reference loop with
an automatic prototype object created for the function.  The function instance's
<code>prototype</code> property points to the prototype object, and the prototype's
<code>constructor</code> property points back to the function instance.  Only
mark-and-sweep is able to collect these reference loops at the moment.  If you
build with reference counting only (not recommended), function instances may
appear to leak memory; the memory will be released when the relevant heap is
destroyed.</p>

<p>You can break the reference loops manually (although this is a bit cumbersome):</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
var f = function() { };
var g = function() { };
var h = function() { };
Duktape.fin(f, function() { print('finalizer for f'); });
Duktape.fin(g, function() { print('finalizer for g'); });
Duktape.fin(h, function() { print('finalizer for h'); });

// not collected until heap destruction in a reference counting only build
f = null;            // not collected immediately

// break cycle by deleting 'prototype' reference (alternative 1)
g.prototype = null;
g = null;            // collected immediately, finalizer runs

// break cycle by deleting 'constructor' reference (alternative 2)
h.prototype.constructor = null;
h = null;            // collected immediately, finalizer runs

// mark-and-sweep triggers finalizer for 'f'
Duktape.gc();
</pre>

<p>For internal technical reasons, named function expressions are also in a
reference loop with an internal environment record object.  This loop cannot
be broken from user code and only mark-and-sweep can collect such functions.
Ordinary function declarations and anonymous functions don't have this
limitation.  Example:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
var fn = function myfunc() {
    // myfunc is in reference loop with an internal environment record,
    // and can only be collected with mark-and-sweep.
}
</pre>

<p>Since Duktape 2.x mark-and-sweep is always enabled so that objects
participating in reference loops are eventually freed.  You can disable
periodic "voluntary" (non-emergency) mark-and-sweep via config options
to reduce collection pauses in time sensitive environments.</p>

<h2>Non-standard function 'caller' property limitations</h2>

<p>When <code>DUK_USE_NONSTD_FUNC_CALLER_PROPERTY</code> is given, Duktape
updates the <code>caller</code> property of non-strict function instances
similarly to e.g. V8 and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/caller">Spidermonkey</a>.
There are a few limitations, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a (non-strict) function is called from eval code, Duktape sets
    <code>caller</code> to <code>null</code> if the eval code is non-strict,
    and <code>eval</code> (reference to the eval built-in function) if the
    eval code is strict.  This deviates from e.g. V8 behavior.</li>
<li>Coroutines and <code>caller</code> don't mix well: <code>caller</code>
    may be left in a non-<code>null</code> state even after coroutine call
    stacks have been fully unwound.  Also, if a coroutine is garbage collected
    before its call stack is unwound, the <code>caller</code> property of
    functions in its call stack will not get updated now.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the internal <code>test-bi-function-nonstd-caller-prop.js</code> test
case for further details.</p>

<h2>Garbage collection during debugger paused state</h2>

<p>When debugger support is activated, a debugger session is active, and
Duktape is paused, there are a few current limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Because garbage collection is disabled during the paused state, calls to
    <code>Duktape.gc()</code> and <code>duk_gc()</code> will be silently
    ignored.</li>
</ul>
