<h1 id="random">Random numbers</h1>

<p>Random numbers are used internally for <code>Math.random()</code>.
They are also used currently for random pivot selection in the
<code>Array.prototype.sort()</code> implementation.</p>

<p>The default internal random number generator is
<a href="http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/xoroshiro128plus.c">xoroshiro128+</a> with
<a href="http://xorshift.di.unimi.it/splitmix64.c">SplitMix64</a> seed mixing.
<a href="http://www.woodmann.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-3100.html.">Shamir's three-op PRNG</a>
is used on low memory targets and when the compiler doesn't have 64-bit
types.  The generators are not suitable for serious statistics algorithms
due to e.g. limited quality of the seed material, and are not at all
suitable for cryptography.</p>

<p>You can replace the internal random number generator using the
<code>DUK_USE_GET_RANDOM_DOUBLE</code> config option.</p>
