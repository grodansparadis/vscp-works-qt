<p>Duktape is an interpreted engine with currently no JIT support.  It uses
reference counting which makes memory usage tight at the cost of some execution
performance.  Overall Duktape performance should be similar to other interpreted
languages.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://wiki.duktape.org/Performance.html">How to optimize performance</a>
for discussion of Duktape performance characteristics and hints to optimize code
for performance.</p>

<p>Profile guided optimization (PGO) is strongly recommended if performance is
a major concern.  For example, GCC -O2 with PGO can be around 20% faster than
GCC -O2 without PGO.</p>
