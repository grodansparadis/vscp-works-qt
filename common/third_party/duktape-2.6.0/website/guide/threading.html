<h1 id="threading">Threading</h1>

<p>Duktape supports a limited form of multithreading:</p>
<ul>
<li>A particular Duktape heap created with <code>duk_create_heap()</code> is
    single threaded: only one native thread can execute code in the heap at a
    time.  The native thread can change over time, as long as two native threads
    are not active at the same time in the same Duktape heap.</li>
<li>It is possible to suspend Duktape execution in a Duktape/C call using
    <code><a href="api.html#duk_suspend">duk_suspend()</a></code> and later
    resume it with <code><a href="api.html#duk_resume">duk_resume()</a></code>.
    Between these calls another thread may call into the same Duktape heap.
    Application code must manage any locking necessary to ensure only one
    native thread calls into Duktape at a time.</li>
<li>Duktape heaps are completely isolated from each other.  Multiple native
    threads can execute code at the same time, as long as there is only one
    active native thread per Duktape heap.</li>
</ul>

<p>For some background, a Duktape heap is a single memory management region
regardless of how many Duktape threads exist in the heap (don't confuse native
threads and Duktape threads).  Because the Duktape threads in a heap can share
object references, multithreading support would need synchronization for garbage
collection and all object handling.  Synchronization would be a major
portability issue, so a practical approach is to limit a Duktape heap to be
single threaded.  Duktape heaps don't share anything so there are no threading
limitations between them as a general rule.  However, when some platform features
are not available (such as variadic preprocessor macros or re-entrant system calls)
there are some limitations.</p>
